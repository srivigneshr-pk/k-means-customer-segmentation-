# K-Means Customer Segmentation
This project uses *K-Means Clustering* to segment mall customers based on their *Annual Income* and *Spending Score*.
## 📌 Objective
To identify different groups of customers for better marketing strategy using unsupervised learning.
## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset: [Mall Customer Segmentation Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)
- File used: Mall_Customers.csv
## 📊 Features Used for Clustering
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
## 📈 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset
2. Selected relevant features
3. Applied KMeans clustering (with 5 clusters)
4. Visualized customer groups using a scatter plot
## 🖼️ Output
The model generated a plot with 5 distinct customer clusters, each represented by a different color based on income and spending behavior.
## ▶️ How to Run
Make sure you have the dataset in the same directory as the code file.
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
python kmeans_customer_segmentation.py
